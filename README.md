This project contains a Flask web app that prompts the users to submit a movie review on the website and classifies whether the input review is positive or negative by analyzing the data using a trained CNN model. The model is generated by using word-embedding technique to pre-process the input data, and a CNN model is trained on the embedded vectors to classify whether an input sentence represents a positive sentiment or a negative sentiment. The model was trained on 70% of the data, and tested on the remaining 30%, where the model yielded an 81% accuracy on the testing set. The model parameters were tweaked to yield the most accurate model, which was then stored using joblib module. The flask app communicates with the front end using restAPI, where the front end transfers the user input to the back end for processing the input review. The backend predicts the classification of the input using the trained CNN model, and assigns a label along with a confidence score on the input, which is again shown to the user on the front end.

Required modules:

    numpy
    tensorflow
    scikit-learn
    flask
    joblib

To run the program, clone the repository to your device and follow the following commands:
